# Land of the Divided, a Hearts of Iron IV total conversion mod

![Screenshot of a divided America in the mod.](/mod_map.png)

The premise of the scenario is a (not strict) reverse of the Cold War, where the United States "loses" the Cold War through economic and military mishaps, and as a result the Soviet Union reigns victorious. Following such turmoil in the United States, conservative (and more radical) forces conspire in the National July 4th Movement (akin to the August Coup) to capture Clinton after his victory in the 1996 election. As a result, military, Movement, federal, and state forces clash, with no decisive winner, resulting in a frozen conflict until the start date where the American Spring has led to many highly successful revolts, forcing nations to build up and remilitarize again.
