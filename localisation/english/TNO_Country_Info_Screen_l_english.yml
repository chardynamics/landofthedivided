 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Folder.101: "Land of the Divided"

 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.1: "The Civil War"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.1: "§WLand of the Divided§! answers the question of what a §YCivil War§! would look like in the scenario of an §eSoviet§! victory in the §BCold War§!. Mirroring the paths of the §eSoviet Union§! and the §aUnited States§! except in reverse, in the late 90s a §Ycivil war§! between the conservative §sNational July 4th Movement§! and §Qmilitary & government forces§! breaks out.\n\nAfter a failure to achieve a §Ydecisive victory§! from both sides, the §mbattlefield of America§! lays dormant while the factions lick their wounds. Mechanics of §wproxy wars§!, §Driver navigation§!, and the §Oeconomic and social mechanics§! of §WTNO§! are present here."

 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.3: "Proxy Wars"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.3: "It does not mean that war is uncommon in §WLand of the Divided§!. On the contrary, war is actually §Gextremely common§! and you will fight several as almost every nation. However, before the revival of the §d2nd American Civil War§! wars are not normally expressed through direct conflict, but instead as §wProxy Wars§!. §wProxy Wars§! are wars between two nations, who are backed by two larger nations using their conflict as a way to battle one another without an outright battle. These can also occur during §YCivil Wars§!, which are also exceedingly common.\n\nDuring a §wProxy War§!, nations at war with one another may find themselves being supported by an outside ideologically or aligned nation. They will be able to support their side via the §WVolunteer System§! as in vanilla §WHearts of Iron IV§!."

 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.4: "The Major Powers Interface"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.4: "Of course, there is a way to measure and keep track of the contenders to national domination. The button in the shape of the §MAmerican eagle§! in the top bar will lead you to the §YMajor Power Interface§!. It will tell you everything you need to know about those competing in the §BCivil War§!, which is currently winning by how much, and in what ways, along with other useful informations.\n\nThe §Yrankings§! tab shows you which country is currently in the lead, calculated by factors such as their §Rmilitary§! and §Geconomic§! power. The §Rtensions§! tab records the palpability of relations between great powers, as well as the incidents that led to this development of tension. The §Gspheres§! tab highlights the economic sphere of the major powers, showing their raw economic power and influence amongst other nations."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.5: "Naval Warfare"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.5: "§WLand of the Divided§! ultimately takes place during a Civil War solely within the scope of the §MUnited States§!. As a result, mechanics not able to be covered by §WHearts of Iron IV§! such as dealing with §Qrivers§! can be modelled here. These will require special attention for troop movements, during §Ypeacetime§! as well as during §ecombat§!.\n\nAdjacencies modelling §Ybridges§! can be used for easy transportation, but control of §Qrivers§! must occur navally as well. On the other side, naval invasions can surprise §ethe enemy§! for §Ytotal victory§!."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Folder.102: "Mechanics"
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.6: "The Economy"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.6: "§WLand of the Divided§! features a complex §Weconomy§! mechanic. You can access your economic overview by clicking upon the §Wglobe sign§! in between the §Wresearch§! and §WMajor Powers§! tabs. The foundation of your national economy is your §GGDP§!, which will be the key to the economic prosperity of your state. Your §GGDP§! needs to be balanced out with your §Rdebt§!. Every year, interest upon your §Rdebt§! will be deducted as an expense, and ending up with too high of a §RDebt§! to §GGDP§! ratio could spell financial ruin.\n\nTo avoid troubling economic times, keep a watchful eye upon your §Gincome§! and your §Yexpenditures§!. Your §Gincome§! is determined by multiple factors, the most obvious of which being your §GGDP§!. Many other factors come to play, however, such as your industry, poverty rate, academia, and much more! On the other hand, you have your §Yexpenditures§!, the bane of any economist. §YExpenditures§! are a measure of factors such as military upkeep, social securities, construction projects, and more."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.7: "Laws and Social Development"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.7: "Taking inspiration from the law system of Victoria 2, §WLand of the Divided§! features a detailed law system to express the specific §Ypolicies§! of your nation, providing greater immersion and complexity. Your §Ypolicies§! are located under the §Wpolitical§! tab, and includes a wide range of §Ypolicies§! to consider during the course of your playthrough. Each §Ypolicy§! has its own effects on various game variables, with both pros and cons to each §Ypolicy§!.\n\nFurthermore, each §Ypolicy§! has §Yeffectiveness§! which can improve or worsen as the game goes on, with some being determined by buildings and funding. This determines the effects gained by a §Ypolicy§! and the more effective a §Ypolicy§!, the better the effects.\n\nFinally, §Ysocietal development§! represents the progress of your country and can trend towards positive progress or negative progress, §Gupgrading§! or §Rdowngrading§! throughout your playthrough."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.8: "Country Specific Mechanics"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.8: "Many of the countries in §WLand of the Divided§! feature expansive §GScripted GUIs§! designed to add more depth to your §Rgameplay experience§!, and make peacetime gameplay more interactive. §GDecision Scripted GUIs§! are built directly into the §Ydecisions tab§!, and can be accessed simply by opening the tab. \n\nOn the other hand, §GFull Scripted GUIs§! are accessed via the §Ypolitics tab§!, using a button located below your §Wcountry leader's portrait§!, next to the §WHead of Government's portrait§!. These §GFull Scripted GUIs§! tend to be much more in-depth, and are oftentimes vital to a country's §Rgameplay experience§!. Furthermore, most §GScripted GUIs§! also feature an §Yinfo button§!, which, when §Rhovered over or clicked on§!, will display helpful information on how the interface works and other features of the §Rintegrated mechanic§!."
