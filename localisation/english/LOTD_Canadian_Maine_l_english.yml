 CMM_Walter_Natynczyk: "Walter Natynczyk"
 POLITICS_WALTER_NATYNCZYK_DESC: "Walter Natynczyk has dealt with mission after mission, and this Mission will be no different. Chief of Canadian forces in Maine, his task is to stabilize the region, and hopefully destroy the Maine Republic. However this time, his hands are tied.\n\nBorn to Polish and German immigrants, his humble origins quickly grew as by 1994, he became Chief of Land Operations of UNPROFOR in Yugoslavia. However, quells in America caused him to be recalled domestically as Canadian leaders dealt with the rapid changes of the Second American Civil War. Canada's reliance on the US and NATO (which began to dissolve) necessitated Canada and it's armed forces to be self reliant. Natynczyk would be key in these, continuing to rise up the chain of command.\n\nNow his next task will be his hardest: an intervention in Maine. Fears of the Maine Republic's insurgency spilling over the border led Natynczyk to lead forces across the border - leading to a Mission that continues today. While initially popular, the continued existence of the Maine Republic and it's growing insurgency has begun to turn opinion against the Mission. Natynczyk, unable to be authorized to start an offensive for thoughts of American escalation ends up as a scapegoat for the debacle. However, if the insurgency escalates, he may be able to sway enough favor to end the Republic once and for all."
 CMM_Symbol_Of_Canadian_Intervention: "Symbol of Canadian Intervention"
 CMM_Symbol_Of_Canadian_Intervention_desc: "Across the Northern border, signs of Canadian interference range a variety of methods. Yet in Aroostook, the most flagrant symbol of meddling comes from Canadian boots on the ground. The protracted conflict in Maine has "necessitated" the use of a peacekeeping mission, unilaterally, with an escalating insurgency. While popular with Canadians for the successful use of the military for stability, its long-lasting presence has called into question whether they will ever withdraw."
 CMM_Smooth_Administration: "Smooth Sailing"
 CMM_Smooth_Administration_desc: "Regardless of the active but slow conflict, the Mission is currently successful with its operational goal: stability in Maine. After the massive outflow of American refugees north-ward destroyed order in border states, daily life has rebounded. Backed by Canadian troops, the Mission functions as a rare example of stability in the Northeast. Yet, with tensions rising in Maine and America, it is uncertain how long this era of prosperity will last. Yet for now, Mainers will reap it's benefits."
 CMM_Drawn_Out_Occupation: "Drawn Out Occupation"
 CMM_Drawn_Out_Occupation_desc: "While the Mission successfully limited the potency of the Maine Republic, it has only slowed down the trajectory of the conflict. Each day, Movement insurgents infiltrate across our perimeter operating with freedom. The expectations of "maintaining peace" have kneecapped the Mission's desires and abilities. With each death of a soldier or civilian, there is an increasing feeling that decisive action is necessary; yet just like the rest of the continent, no side is able to make the first step."
