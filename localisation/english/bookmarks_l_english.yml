 LOTD_NAME: "The New Order"
 LOTD_DESC: "With the triumph of the Axis over the Allied powers, a New Order has descended upon the world. In the places of Union Jack and the Hammer and Sickle now soar the Rising Sun and Swastika. A single light flickers desperately against the night in the United States; Germany celebrates the first man on the moon as Europe chafes; and Japan lines its pockets as China's slumber slowly breaks. The Mediterranean lies on a knife's edge, and what remains of Russia prepares to realize its destiny."

Guangdong exists as a twilight zone between China and Japan, spurned by the former and neglected by the latter.\n\nUnder your leadership, Guangdong, its Three Pearls, and its three peoples - the Chinese, Japanese, and Zhujin - walk into an uncertain future, searching for an existential purpose beyond profit margins and boardroom politics.§!"

They don't see sweat-stained aid workers or white-collared staffers but tax dollars leaving the country to an unspecified end. If they knew Nixon sent American guns to Malagasy insurgents or that CIA aid overthrew the Surinamese government, it might inspire mistrust among the American public for operations abroad. To this end, dirty dealings on the world stage are kept strictly confidential.\n\nIn addition to a reworked Malagasy Revolt proxy war, players can intervene in two new conflicts in the United States' backyard. In Haiti, decades of American-sponsored stagnation have inspired dissidents to reject the government's legitimacy and instead seek revolutionary solutions. Simmering rage resulting from OFN omnipresence has caused many Icelanders to question their association with the international alliance, and outbreaks of anti-American sentiment worldwide have the New Colossus in an uncomfortable position.  Even with  good intentions, poor decisions in these critical moments could determine Washington's hegemony in the free world.§!"

 SAF_THENEWORDER_DESC: "A monarchy without a monarch and a nation without direction, the Union of South Africa has found itself increasingly struggling to hold back the forces of unrest waiting to tear the nation asunder.\n\nWhile the Boers have never managed to take power in the nation, their presence is felt as more and more they clamor for either representation or outright independence. Elsewhere, the Africans shout from the streets against a nation of segregation, if not in law than in practice. If its domestic issues were not enough, South Africa finds itself torn between two spheres, constantly being pressured by the Americans to join the OFN and the Germans to bow to the Reich."
